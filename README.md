## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajendranali/taiyo-contacts-management.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd taiyo-contacts-management
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information on running tests, refer to the [Create React App testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
The build is minified and filenames include hashes for better performance.\
Your app is ready for deployment.

For more information on deployment, refer to the [Create React App deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

#### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!\
This command removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.\
All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can customize them.

You don’t have to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments. However, if you need to customize the build tools, `eject` is available.
